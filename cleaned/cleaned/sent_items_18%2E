good morning darling,do you know when the ubs paydays are?  we are just trying to figure out what to expect.also,  i need a copy of my signed agreement with ubs, the loan folks for my new condo want it.  if you will fax it to me, but call me first so i can wait by the fax for it, i would be grateful.thanks,cara freeland! ;)
