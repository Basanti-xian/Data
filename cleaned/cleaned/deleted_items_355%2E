cara,i fixed the locking problem on the build route sheet.  corry had asked that the application not allow anyone from deleting data from the build route grid.  this is to protect against deals being pulled in a second time and being accidentally duplicated in the workspace.  corry,i know you asked if we could have a button to clear the build route data, so as to start from scratch.  i haven't forgotten... just haven't had a chance to implement it.with kind regards,will
