how are you doing this morning? how did everything work out with the house and everybody looking at it? work is pretty boring today. i am trying to make a flow chart for the very first time. i'm using visio to create the chart so it will take me some extra time because i don't know what i'm doing. i am so tired. i think it's because i haven't had any sugar in two days. hopefully i will start to get used to this soon. i know it is going to be well worth the effort in the long run. i love you so much. thank you for helping me get healthy. you are a wonderful person and i am so lucky to have you in my life. :)i love you baby. i miss you and i can't wait to see you tonight. i love you. craig. p.s. did i mention that i love you?? :)
