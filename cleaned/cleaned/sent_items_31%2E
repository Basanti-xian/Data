everything that we use is located in p:/scheduling.  you will find old sheets with tags and paths, documents outlining how the system works, how daylight savings time needs to be represented, there is also the intranet sitep:\scheduling\enronwestschedulingwebsite.htmlon this there is the oati links, and also the test site for oati ..  this will go live in april, and will be totally different than any tagging done before. you will need time to get familiar with the new format and practice, and i will be happy to help guide you when you are ready.all  of us are here to help, and will be available to you until you are comfortable.good luck!cara
