cara, yes, primarily due to some additional requests that corry has surfaced during user acceptance testing.  (i copied corry on this in case you want to discuss with him)  he is looking for a number of excel type features that are not part of will's grid object.  will is doing some additional research for me on this...give me a call if you want to discuss.  as always, thanks for your interest and engagement.steve
