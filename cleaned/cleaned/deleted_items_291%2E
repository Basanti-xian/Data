cara,		looking at the stage and production versions of the deal scheduling application it looks like the stage version has some issues/differences.. [e.g being that check option for cross portfolio deals is in stage and not production release].  this issue will be addressed but the current workaround would be to make sure the checkbox is checked in stage for retrieving proper results.. 	please do let me know if you have any questions/concerns..regardsasemx
