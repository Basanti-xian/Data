hello.  how's life?  mine is pretty good.  i have a face to face interview with merch pharmaceuticals.  i guess i did ok on the phone interview even though i didn't think they'd call me back. question for you.  i was wondering if you could change the first sentence in my letter of recommendation because it talks about fmla leave and the dates i worked at enron, which i have on my resume, but i'd rather they didn't know that i have a little one because i don't want them to judge me by that.. or think i'll be a slacker because i won't, and i already have the same babysitter set up and ready to go.  (if i get lucky and get the job)...  :)  i could come by one afternoon this week to pick it up because my interview is tuesday.  what do you think?  no big deal if not, just thought i'd try.   also, i'm taking emily to gymboree (a baby class) and chris calgar's(spelling???) wife and son are in it.  i just met her tuesday for the first time.  i guess they are moving to houston the end of march. hope all is well and maybe we'll see you soon.  emily is such a chunk now. susie wilson
