----- original message ----- from: jon & amanda morsics <mailto:surfgator@ev.net> to: pat kennedy <mailto:reefrashman@houston.rr.com> sent: saturday, january ,  : pmsubject: fw: message from marine recon in afganistanthought you might find this interesting ... got it from a friend at work.  the following was read on the sully and scooter (radio kogo in san  diego) show on nov. :     just outside of ab gach, in the northwest panhandle of afghanistan  between tajikstan and pakistan, november , .     bizarre, it's (expletive) freezing here. i'm sitting on hard, cold  dirt between rocks and shrubs at the base of the hindu kush mountains along  the dar 'yoi pomir river watching a hole that leads to a tunnel that leads  to a cave. stake out, my friend, and no pizza delivery for thousands of  miles.           i also glance at the area around my ass every ten to fifteen seconds  to avoid another scorpion sting. i've actually given up battling the  chiggers and sand fleas, but them (expletive) scorpions give a jolt like a  cattle prod. hurts like a bastard. the antidote tastes like transmission  fluid but god bless the marine corps for the five vials of it in my pack.     the one truth the taliban cannot escape is that, believe it or not,  they are human beings, which means they have to eat food and drink water.  that requires couriers and that's where an old bounty hunter like me comes  in handy. i track the couriers, locate the tunnel entrances and storage  facilities, type the info into the handheld, shoot the coordinates up to the  satellite link that tells the air commanders where to drop the hardware, we  bash some heads for a while, then i track and record the new movement. it's  all about intelligence.     we haven't even brought in the snipers yet. these scurrying rats  have no idea what they're in for. we are but days away from cutting off  supply lines and allowing the eradication to begin. i dream of bin laden  waking up to find me     standing over him with my boot on his throat as i spit a bloody ear  into his face and plunge my nickel plated bowie knife through his frontal  lobe. but you know me. i'm a romantic.     i've said it before and ill say it again: this country blows, man.  it's not even a country. there are no roads, there's no infrastructure,  there's no government. this is an inhospitable, rockpit (expletive) ruled by  eleventh century warring tribes.  there are no jobs here like we know jobs.  afghanistan offers two ways for a man to support his family: join the opium  trade or join the army. that's it. those are your options. oh, i forgot, you  can also live in a refugee camp and eat plum-sweetened, crushed beetle paste  and squirt mud like a goose with stomach flu if that's your idea of a party.  but the smell alone of those "tent cities of the walking dead" is enough to  hurl you into the poppy fields to cheerfully scrape bulbs for eighteen hours  a day.     and let me tell you something else. i've been living with these  tajiks and uzbeks and turkmen and even a couple of pushtins for over a month  and a half now and this much i can say for sure: these guys, all of em, are  huns. actual, living huns. they live to fight. its what they do. its all  they do. they have no  respect for anything, not for their families or for  each other or for themselves. they claw at one another as a way of life.  they play polo with dead calves and force their five-year-old sons into  human cockfights to defend the family honor. huns, roaming packs of savage,  heartless beasts who feed on each other's barbarism. (expletive) cavemen  with ak 's.            then again, maybe i'm just cranky. i'm freezing my (expletive) off  on this stupid (expletive) hill because my lap warmer is running out of  juice and i can't recharge it until the sun comes up in a few hours. oh  yeah! you like to write letters, right? do me a favor, bizarre. write a  letter to cnn and tell judy and bernie and that awful, sneering, pompous  aaron brown to stop calling the taliban "smart." they are not smart. i  suggest cnn invest in a dictionary because the word they are looking for is  "cunning." the taliban are cunning, like jackals and hyenas and wolverines.  they are sneaky and ruthless and, when confronted, cowardly. they are  hateful, malevolent parasites who create nothing and destroy everything  else. smart. pfft. yeah, they're real smart. they've spent their entire  lives reading only one book (and not a very good one, as books go) and  consider hygiene and indoor plumbing to be products of the devil. they're  still figuring out how to work a bic lighter. talking to a taliban warrior  about improving his quality of life is like trying to teach an ape how to  hold a pen; eventually he just gets frustrated and sticks you in the eye  with it. ok, enough.           snuffle will be up soon so i have to get back to my hole. covering  my tracks in the snow takes a lot of practice but i'm getting good at it.  please tell my fellow americans to turn off their tv sets and move on with  their lives. the story line you are getting from cnn is utter (expletive)  and designed not to deliver truth but rather to keep you glued to the screen  through the commercials. we've got this one under control. the worst thing  you guys can do right now is sit around analyzing what we're doing over here  because you have no idea what we're doing and, really, you don't want to  know. we are your military and we are doing what you sent us here to do.     you wanna help? buy some (expletive) stocks, america.     saucy jack
