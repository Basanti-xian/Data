chris and i would like to take this opportunity to update everyone on what =has been happening on the floor(s) during the last couple of weeks and what= is likely to transpire in the weeks to come.  i'd like to begin by apologi=zing for the lack of broad e-mail communications or floor meetings over the= last couple of weeks.  these have been very hard times and i know that peo=ple have wanted information.  it has taken us nearly a week to sort through= who will be part of the ubs warburg team and who continue with enron. =in this e-mail i will explain: () who will be going to ubs warburg, () wh=o do the people working for enron work for and what are they expected to do=, () how will the physical separation between enron and ubs warburg happen=, and () when will the sale of netco to ubs warburg be completed.  in addi=tion to chris calger and me, the following portland-based employees have ac=cepted positions with ubs warburg:last name=first name=last name=first name=amador=susan=oh=john=anderson=john=platter=m=bulbes=victor=postlethwaite=john=chang=fang-tzu=richter=jeffrey=chatterton=jill=robinson=donald=crandall=sean=salisbury=holden=cutsforth=diane=scholtes=diana=dasovich=jeff=semperger=cara=davidson=debra=sheidun=donna=dean=craig=shields=jeffrey=dunton=heather=slinger=ryan=etringer=michael=solberg=geir=gilbert=michael "scotty"=steiner=david=gustafson=mollie=stokley=marlin "chris"=hall=stephen=swain=stephen=heizenrader=timothy=swerzbin=michael=kandaswamy=balachandar=thomas=jacob=lackey=christopher=thome=stephen=lee=eugene=van houten=maria=mallory=patrick "chris"=villeggiante=theresa=mcdonald=michael=wente=laura=meyer=james=williams=william j=meyers=albert=woodland=andrea=mier=michael=yoder=christian=nelson=kourtney===while there are a few people who are still making up their minds, the rest =of the people in our office will be working for the enron estate.  it is no=t entirely clear to me right now what the management team for west power lo=oks like for the enron estate now.  as i understand it, there are two prima=ry initiatives on the estate side that people in portland may be a part of.=  the first is the disposition of our development projects that are already= well under way.  dave parquet in san francisco has been leading this effor=t together with the portland asset development team.  this effort has been =ongoing since december.  the second is the disposition of our west power co=mmodity positions.  jim fallon is in charge of this for the entire company.=  people working on this for jim include don miller, paul racicot, brad ric=hter, ed baughman among others.  i have placed a call to jim and to paul to= get advice on how people in portland should proceed.  i would recommend ta=lking to ed, brad, paul, or don to get direction.  i have placed a call to =several of these people to get direction and am waiting for a response.  i =am hopeful that they will designate a lead person in portland to coordinate= the power procurement and delivery efforts.as most of you know, the physical separation between ubs warburg and enron =has already begun.  people who will continue to work for enron will be loca=ted on the th floor, while ubs warburg will occoupy the rd floor.  we hop=e to make the moves to the th floor by the end of this week.  moves within= the rd floor will take place the following week.the ubs warburg transaction is subject to one last pro forma regulatory hur=dle.  while i don't have an exact date, i am told that it will likely be on= or about february th.finally, i want to once again thank everyone for their help and cooperation= over the last few weeks.  these have been really horrible times as the enr=on story continues to unfold in the news at the same time that people are f=inding out about their future with enron and ubs.  i know that this hasn't =been easy for anyone.  i am deeply saddened overseeing the breakup of the a=wesome team that we have put together.  whether you are going to ubs, remai=ning with enron, or leaving the company, i wish everyone who worked on this= team the best in their future endeavors.  it has been a distinct honor to =work with each and every one of you.regards,tim
