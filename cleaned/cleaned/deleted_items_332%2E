cara,first of all, thanks for your input.  regarding the new issues with path confirmation, most of these are simple problems that we can fix easily.  vish is already working on them.  concerning the colors, there are three sets of colors representing market, supply and transmission.  i have asked vish to add a color key that allows you to change the colors to your liking.  this information will be saved are remembered the next time you run the application.regarding pre-schedule, adding print capability to the error log should be no problem.  also, adding "check for errors" functionality will be done.  concerning "capability not supported: deal has multiple delivery points"; i believe this is raised when there are multiple strips (either term or schedule) for a deal, but the strips have different delivery points.  the routing process is not able to determine which strips to use.  i will confirm this.we have already changed path confirmation so that it will display the longer description of the counterparty name.  i may have both the code and description displayed.  i believe corry expects to see the common name in the path confirm records (corry, can you confirm this?).the information you have given us will keep us busy for a couple of days, but if you have more, please send it.thanks,will
