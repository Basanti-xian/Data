hi shirley, the first  minutes or so were spent on going over the groundrules that mike sent out in his //, : pm email.  then we got into bp on reservation timing requirements and went down the bulleted commentsthat mike sent out with his ground rules, starting with the question ofwhether all of the bp's under order  should be in the new bp's.  thisdiscussion lasted about  minutes.  most of the discussion focused on howto deal with the various timing issues (granularity, submittals, approvals,etc.).  finally, it was suggested that a general statement be put in theapplicability section that if  is superceded, a new rule may be needed onthis bp.one of the suggestions was that you need to know what your products arebefore you can determine the timing issues.  we know ferc will be coming outwith a replacement for the pro forma tariff, but mike doesn't want to waitto move forward on the bp's until then.  his goal is to focus on the coreelements of trading/tracking/utilization of rights and then add/subtractonce we know what the new tariff will look like.  it was also suggested thatwe may want to set aside a conference call session just to deal with timingissues to make sure all of the bp's are coordinated on that.he agreed to clean up the inconsistencies related to resales/notice thereofin the bp language.  i believe it was also agreed that the bp's fortransmission should be separate from those for ancillary services (due tofact that some anc services are purchased in bulk for multipletransactions).  mike is planning the next conf call for next wed, noon est and another callabout a week later.  his hope is to go through as many of the bp's aspossible this way.  today we just got through bp.that's about it, unless someone on eswg has something else to add. thanks>
