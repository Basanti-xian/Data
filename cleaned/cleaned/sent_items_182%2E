donald was trying to sort by por and pod,  donald gets a repeating error of "invalid variant type conversion".i tried to do that and no problem, but i am using the app locally, and donald for some reason still has to go thru the windows  terminal server.  i really want him to be able to use the app locally like it was designed to be used.please let me know.c
