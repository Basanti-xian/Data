i have definatly missed you.  i have missed everyone.  i like my new job but sean was right, it is very slow paced here.  i find myself fighting for things to do some of the time.  i live on my own, i really dig my new pad.  it's definatly different living by myself.  please tell everyone i said hello and if they want my address or phone number you are welcome to pass it on.  stacy runswick               hm.
