cara,preschedule:.  concerning the path with transmission data...  the original format was based off of corry's suggestion.  perhaps the two of you need to discuss your needs.  however, i should tell you that your approach will require a database access for each transmission, otherwise there is no way for us to determine the por, pod and firmness for the transmission deal. .  can you give asem and me some deal numbers to look into regarding the northwest delivered deals with multiple delivery points?.  we will resolve the physical / non-physical in the next release, as well as add a "check for errors" button..  determining the cause of the speed issues with creating the confirm records can be time consuming.  we will work on it right away, but in the meantime try working with smaller sets of data.  we will get you a faster solution as soon as possible.path confirm:.  sorting...  are global id and tag sorting, just not in an order that you expect?  our tools are sorting strictly by alphanumeric comparisons.  if you need the values sorted by numbers, putting the numbers ahead of the description will work better for you..  can you give me a specific example of a path that is missing dashes?.  i will have vish change the new path functionality to require both supply and market.  if the delivery points are different, should we require a transmission path record?.  i know we discussed the possibility of tying the new path and path cuts to our other enpower systems.  i apologize if i did not make it clear that this would be a complicated process involving changes to those other applications.  there is currently no plan for including those features in this release.  our goal for the first release was to replace your existing lotus notes system.again, thanks for your testing efforts.  we have come a long way due to your diligence.regards,will
