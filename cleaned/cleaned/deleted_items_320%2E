cara,i was out friday, but totally agree on segregation of east and west confirmations.  also, i agree that there needs to be a method to delete confirmation records (either for mistakes on date, path changes requiring it, etc).  i didn't get any records to go to the confirmation table on thursday, so i'll look at the information on the transmission cells uploaded today.i don't think repeating some of the errors we find is too big of a problem.cb
