hi cara.  how's it going? i left you a message the other day.  just wanted to see if you are doing ok and/or needed anything... emily loves that teddy bear you bought her.  every morning i put it in her crib with her when she first wakes up and it's her best friend.  she gives the bear the biggest smile.  :)  she's growing fast.   / months now.  she rolls onto her stomach all the time and is eating cereal with a spoon.   let me know how things are going. i'll talk to you soon. susie wilson
