john, just a couple of quick comments. first bp  is identified as an "independent issue" and bp  is identified asa "dependent issues", yet both of these bp's work in tandem.  i would thinkboth of these should be "dependent",  unless i am missing something.  iguess i would have the same comment for bp #.the last page describes bp's (, , and ) that the wscc is asking to beworked independently.  i am not sure what this means - a west and eastproposal for each of these practices?  does bp  (curtailments and reloads) assume a common (nationwide)congestion management scheme, or is this bp totally unrelated orinsignificant to any congestion management scheme (physical or financial)?thanks john,john canavanmontana power company>
