good morning,my target testing date today is june th,  i am running in test p in local= enpower using actual data from our scheduling sheets re-arranged to meet t=he new guidelines.the daily deals i coded x in columns j and n,  the month long bookouts and =bom bookouts i coded r. =what worked:i was able to retrieve my saved workspace with all data intact. i had previ=ously sucessfully copied and pasted my entire sheet from excel to the psw.i was able to run the build route report with the criteria of "starting on-= june -paloverde-day of week mask activated-report changes activated." a =check of deals actually scheduled vs. build route results showed that all d=eals were extracted correctly from enpower. because i am working on closed =dates, a cumulative test of this app will not be fully testable until produ=ction. we are expecting to see the same functionality as the current incarn=ation of build route. the data extracted should be read only, time stamped,= and when run mulitple times additional data should be shown below previous=ly extracted data.  the improvement we are expecting to see is the app shou=ld not duplicate deal strips on dates that have no physical power flow. (we=st light load currently does this in start view, but not active view)navigating around the scheduling sheet itself i was able to accurately exec=ute the sort function on a single criteria at a time. multiple sorting will= contunue to be done in excel, or we can do a series of single sorts in the= psw to acheive the same result.routing deals: will had deleted all routes for june th, starting me with =a clean slate.  i made every path be for day. i was unable to confirm total= unrouted mwh, as the real time position manager does not seem to be functi=oning in testp. the routing appeared to take  minutes with the status bar= showing steady progress during that time. this time is - minutes longe=r than current speed using the excel macro system we have now. the error li=st gave me a row by row description of what did not route, a very useful to=ol.  ok was visible on all rows that the psw believed that it had routed. i= had difficulty checking the routing results, as i kept getting bde errors =in scheduling after routing had occurred (local enpower). scheduling kept s=tarting up in .  i was unable to login to testp through terminal server= , but was able to in terminal server . the results there were very encou=raging! most routing was done, and a spot check of deals shows that they we=re routed properly. the deals that were not routed appear to be due to a us=er error of deal number duplication in the sheet. this is consistent with w=hat i would expect. i will further evaluate routing ability with our more c=omplicated paths later. this routing was very easy, a large point with on p=eak non shaped deals only.things i did not expect that i liked:when i highlight a group of cells in build route, it stays highlighted when= i move up to the scheduling sheet to highlight a comparison group of cells=.  this is very handy for double checking build route against the scheduler='s sheet.what does not appear to be working at this time:the physical or not physical flag of path does not seem to be showing up pr=operly in routing.path confirmation:  the running time appeared to be over one hour for one s=heet, only  rows of the sheet being flagged for insertion into confirmati=on. this current speed will not be sufficient to work in production. also, =many rows that were flagged for confirmation were not imported, and i canno=t find an error log to help understand why deals were not imported to path =confirmation.when the path confirmation task was finished,  the application simply froze=.  the status bar was no longer visible, leading me to believe that it was =done, however the app was not able to be saved or closed or examined furthe=r.my conclusions:the build route and routing functions work well enough to use in production=, the copy-paste function works well for the west desk per our connectivity= issues.path confirmation is not functioning at this point, and appears to be blowi=ng up the app. no data was visible for june th even after the psw ran thr=ough its import function.please let me know when the issues i have named have been addressed and are= ready for further testing.thankscara/-
