good question, bob, as this is new to me, too.  here's my understanding.while a "path" can be either one line or a group of lines, it has abeginning and an end (a por and a pod).  example: midway to cob.a "flowgate", on the other hand, is a reference monitoring position(which can physically be a collection of locations lumped into a virtualpoint).  it can be used for scheduling as well as for metering and isgenerally described as going "into" somewhere.  example: you couldcombine cob and nob into a single flowgate defined as "into california(southbound)"."granularity" refers to the degree of detail in your model (i.e., towhat extent it is seen through a wide-angle lens vs. through amagnifying glass).  so far, i've seen it applied to schedule changes (how many times an hour), transmission products (howsmall a time increment someone can buy) and transmission grids.  withrespect to transmission grids, it can be used to describe both paths andflowgates.  here's a pair of examples: the mc cullough  - eldorado path (one line,  feet long -- part of a model with smallgranularity), and "into wscc" (a flowgate in a model with extremelylarge granularity).  when i wrote "the more granular the flowgate model" below, i meant "thelarger the scale of your transmission model by flowgates"; in fact, ihad the "into wscc" example in mind at the time, whereby someone in theeastern interconnection could conceivably purchase a transmission rightto send energy westward to a sink anywhere in the westerninterconnection.i'm cc-ing the rest of the eswg on this message in case (as i suspect) iowe our other colleagues the same clarification.your fellow student,john
