the enpower database will be down from  pm friday afternoon ( pm houston) to  pm saturday afternoon (pm houston).  the reason for this is the netco/estate database and hardware split that is occuring this weekend.  you must re-boot your machines following this shut down to access any enpower applications.susan amador.. office
