cara,we store the region from the path cuts in the database as a single enpower region.  that means that we can only map california to one of r, r, and r.  are you intending the regions within path confirmation to represent a group of enpower regions?  if so, we will need to make a database change to store those groupings.  i expect that the database change would take a long time because it will involve a global database change.thanks,will
