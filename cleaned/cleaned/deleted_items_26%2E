i spoke with julie and asked her again as well....my only concern with ubs is that they are swamped at the moment, and these requests usually take a day or two to turnaround (i have put the request to ubs as well - so lets see who does it first!).let me know if you get it from julie or if i receive from ubs first, will give you a call to fax.amy
