amy -that's the best news i've heard all day! looks like we're getting this checkout process down to a science. as far as the new scheduling fee, i'm being told that we're still negotiating a way to enter this into enpower. i'll let you know once i've talked with cara and greg to determine whether or not it will be a price adjustment per mw on each deal or a lump sum annuity each month. in the meantime, just let me know when you have more information on the buy-resale prices - i think i have an answer for you.thanks,kate --
