cara,	looking into the physical and bookout summary reports, upon recreating the functionality there are certain sections to the report which we aren't clear on.. we are still needing to know which delivery points to map the following summary sections to:	cob	pv 		[currently mapped to palo verde]	midc 		[currently mapped to mid columbia]	nwmisc	swmisc	california	[currently mapped to  np-, sp and zp]	we've recreated the reporting functionality [excel based]  from within our new application.. and upon obtaining these mappings we can push this out to production for ya'll  asap.  if you'd like to have the summary report information dumped into the 'aggregate schedule volume report' we can definitely do that; but, would require us more time to get that functionality to you. thanksasemx
