cara,	reason for the error is that the file it was looking for was titled physicalandbookoutsummary_v__westtestp.xls . ive gone ahead and made changes to the application to read the file named as such. since we're talking about locations of these summary files.. is the production report located at o:\portland\westdesk\scheduling\physicalandbookoutsummary_v__westprod.xls ? unfortunately i dont have access to the directories to find out for myself. thanksasemx
