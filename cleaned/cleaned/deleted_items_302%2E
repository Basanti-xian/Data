cara,it appears that some clarification on the regions is necessary.  vish has implemented the cuts to show regions as defined by the regions table in enpower.  this is the same table that is used in many of our reports.  should the regions that you are speaking of be separate from enpower's list of regions?  vish tells me that "california" equates to all of np-, sp-, zp-.  also he is unable to resolve "northwest".    should we not resolve your list of regions to the enpower list?also, as an aside, i took a look at the west discussion - schedule information in notes and noticed that when looking at cuts the tree hierarchy was as followshour ahead / real-timeregion?  (e.g.  montana, marketer, wscc, nw, sw, fed utility)datepathcutsis the second item in the tree related to the region selection for path cuts?thanks,will
