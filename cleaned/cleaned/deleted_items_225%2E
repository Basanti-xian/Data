hello all!we thought we would clarify the parking & mass transit options:) three options are available:wtc/outside parking lots- those who park at wtc will continue to be set up with monthly parking deductions- those who park in outside lots pay out-of-pocket and submit reimbursement for up to $. per monthtri-met- no out-of-pocket expense or paycheck deduction.daily validations- employees may park at any location and submit reimbursement for up to $. per month.) you may choose only one of these available options.- if you selected the mass transit option, you must pay out-of-pocket (with no reimbursement) for parking fees incurred on days you choose to drive into the office.) if you would like to change your parking/mass transit option, please contact grace or julie.if you have any questions, please let us know.thanks!your hr team------------------grace, xjulie, x
