bus passes are available for the month of february so let me know if you want a bus pass.  as noted in previous emails from julie, parking will be paid by enron up to $ per month for each employee, and employees make their own parking arrangements.  it's my understanding parking will be paid (reimbursed) for the month of february up to $.  however, i think the wtc parking may be handled differently.  please see julie if you park in wtc since i am not in that loop.  going forward beyond february, i am not sure if ubs warburg will pay for parking/bus/tri-met, but i will let you know if i hear something.
