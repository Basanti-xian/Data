hi my man, yokos! mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm    i went to see dr. soot today, she told me my pain is from the  big knots where they started and ended the incisions, and it will only hurt for ...oh.... months or so.  she also said i can do whatever i want, including the gym! your ass is mine!  ;)  she said lifting etc is fine as long as i listen to my pain and lift things slowly. no jerky or quick lifting that could hurt me. i can't wait to have some albacore sashimi and a little craig on the sheetsheemi!  ;) love, c
