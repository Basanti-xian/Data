hey guys - well, i had to learn some cod scheduling fast this afternoon, (we really do need to exchange new cell phone numbers :-)). anyway, tag # was incorrect and bpa called about :.  i cancelled that tag and replaced it with tag #i hope what i did was okay, let me know if i should have done it differently.  on the nw sheet that tag number is highlighted in yellow in case there is a problem.  i assume the something needs to be corrected in the preschedule workspace, but i don't know what it is, so i will leave it to cara or donald to explain it to me in the morning.  thanks again, serena
