it has come to my attention that there seems to be miscommunication between various groups and people about how dec and jan scheduling for non-terminated deals should be handled. there are conflicting reports that houston, through the estate, will handle updating scheduling in enpower or that the scheduling group should be updating enpower accordingly.what i am hoping for is that by whatever communications means necessary we can come to a final action plan on how to clean this and get enpower up to date as quickly and as accurately as possible.thanks,john
