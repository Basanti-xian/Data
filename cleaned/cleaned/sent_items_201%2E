auntie cara, how are you?  i am doing fine, i guess.  i think i am passing through the shock stage and may be entering the exceptance stage.  i am still so dazed from this whole thing.  i am supposed to go back to work on the th and may not be going back at all.  this whole thing is so heartbreaking.   i am attaching my resume just so you have it, if you think of anyone who should see it from you contacts please pass it on. take care and i will keep you posted. susan
