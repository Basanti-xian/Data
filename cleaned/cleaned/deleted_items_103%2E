good morning my sweet sweet girl. i love you so much. i hope you slept really well last night. i think i may have to cave in and go see the doctor about my little problem. while i'm there i will inquire about the sleep disorder stuff as well. :-( "why are you putting that glove on doc" eeewww!!!really looking forward to that let me tell ya. i hope you have a relaxing day today baby. don't strain yourself today ok, you need to heal still and i don't like that you are not taking care of yourself. i worry that you will hurt yourself. i love you so much and i don't like seeing you in pain. maybe tonight we can go see black hawk down if you want. or we can just sit around like lumps tonight. i love you so much. it doesn't matter to me what we do as long as we are together, that's all i care about. you are such a wonderful person. i can't believe that it is me that gets to be with you. i got the best prize of all...you!! i love you sweetie. i'll see you when i get home. cv.
