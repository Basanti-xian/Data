good morning honey,i didn't really sleep well last night, so i am tired and cranky today. however, the feeling of rfp is something to grin about. today i am tying out our february positions with the traders so that they can pre-pay their trades for scheduling feb .  just spreadsheet and number crunching stuff.  you are so important to me, i can't hardly articulate how much you mean to me. i love you and am so proud and happy to be yours. i can't wait till we share a home and i am 'out' to my family.  i want to tell them, "this is done" not "this is what i am going to do".  i love waking up in your arms and feeling your kisses first thing in the morning. the sleep thing will work itself out, i am not worried about it.i am looking forward to forever with you.love,cf
