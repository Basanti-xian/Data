hi dear man,i feel the same way that you do, i feel like you are a gift that the universe has given to me. you are such a rare and special man. i love being with you and having fun with you, i love your tenderness and your competitiveness and your sense of humor.  what did i ever do to deserve you!if we aren't too tired tonight, let's go poke around a store or something. maybe linens and things to look for kitchen stuff??  we are going to have such fun together.i love you,cf
