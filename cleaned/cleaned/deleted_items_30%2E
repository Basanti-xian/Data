i love you very much sweetie. i'm sorry it's boring in there for you. i hope you can get out a little early today so you can get a little rest and get the things you want to do around the house done. it must be kind of sad to be there right now. how is the thing you were worried about friday working out. did you talk to sean about it yet? i hope he feels the same way you do about it.  i love getting up with you too, scurrying around the house trying to get ready for work together and being late anyway, despite our hurry-up-ed-ness. :)we are going got be very happy in our life together. it just feels so right. i was looking at the pictures of our place with somebody just a few minutes ago. i'm very excited about us in our place. i can't wait to be with you in there, entertain people and have years of fun there. you are the love of my life. i love you. i'll see you soon baby. cv. p.s.  day to go. :)
