hi there,i love you, i hope you have a good day.  work is shaping up to be a real snooze-fest. there are only  of us on the entire trading floor right now. normally there used to be about - of us!waking up with you is so nice, i am looking forward to many years of doing just that. i think we are going to settle in just fine together. i love you and enjoy being with you so much. you are the man i have waited all these years for. thank you for being part of my life.i will see you this evening, a little dinner, a little laundry action, maybe a little dominoes and sheet-she-me?  woohoo!i love you,cf
