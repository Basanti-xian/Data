lloyd / corry, do you folks know what is driving the cutover for monday morning rather than wednesday evening as planned?  we have been planning on being ready for wednesday morning and monday will cause some unnecessary grief. bill, can you work with erik and dean in houston and cara and mike in portland to ensure that they have the required logins to estate systems to schedule next week. thanks, tom.
