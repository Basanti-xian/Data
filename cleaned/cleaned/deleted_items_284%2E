corry,	as per will, the understanding was that deals with transmissions were far and few in between and were currently being manually routed, and this was not a feature to be expected with the current version of preschedule workspace and so it will not route currently.	issue with deal scheduling not showing the correct 'physical route' status has been addressed and is currently being worked on and will be released within the next day or two. the "edit strip information" bug has been forwarded also.		able to recreate the 'edit' bug and fixed, a new version will roll out by afternoon containing the fix. 	in regards to the west paths showing up when east criteria was selected, this issue was found out to be related to a database modification that was made to include the region code to all transactions. creating the region field, non-nullable requirement, in the database required a default value to be inserted and 'east' was chosen; hence transactions which were for the west desk without an initial region fell into this particular problem.  the erroneous data within the path schedule confirmations has been deleted and all new confirmed paths will now correctly be displayed since our applications correctly state the region information associated with each user.	i will update everyone upon a new version of preschedule workspace being moved to stagethanksasemx
