cara,		thanks for stepping me through deal scheduling to see exactly what the problem was in regards to the physical/non-physical issue.  addressed this issue and we have someone currently looking at this issue and will try and get this kicked out asap. the two other apps are in stage and the schedules for our test date have been erased.. i will notify you immediately once we have deal scheduling's issue resolved.thanksasemx
