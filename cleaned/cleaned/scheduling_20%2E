the carp it people : hmmmm i don't know if they exist  - i got a kick out of that one!yes i do have a call into it - they are working on a solution for carp.in the meantime when dealing with a monthly demand charge - make sure only one strip contains the demand charge.the reason we had the problem with april is because the system automatically created the  strips due to the time change.so to avoid any problems until this has been fixed - if you have a deal with multiple strips - and have a monthly demand charge / mw,make sure only one strip has the demand charge price entered.i will keep you updated on this issue.let me know if you have any additional questions.-heather
