hi mom,things are a little better here for me, friday was a horrible day, we had layoffs of about % of our office.  lots of crying and sadness on the floor.   the weekend was strange, dave came back from eugene un announced which was not what we agreed to, and i got the feeling that he was thinking he was going to 'catch' me doing something or having someone over.  he is still really struggling with the idea that i just can't love him like a wife anymore, and that is not enough to keep two people together.  i wish that i could make this easier on him, and i almost think that if i had been unfaithful it would be easier for him to accept.i am just trying to hold on until he gets some kind of income so that we can sell the house and pay our debt. i do not have any desire for him to be forced to live with his parents, i wouldn't wish that on anyone. just pray for him and for me.school sounds wonderful, i am so glad you are happy dealing with your little ones. how fun!  i love you!cara
