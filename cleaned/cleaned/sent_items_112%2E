should we go ahead and separate our names on the credit cards?  i think it would be wise.also, if you want to transfer pahio to our joint account that is fine,  i would like to have pahio.when you come up, if you want to come to work here and get the car and give me the truck keys, we can do that.  just let me know.thanks,c
