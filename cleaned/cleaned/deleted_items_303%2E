cara,	not a prob, the application wont look at the prod summary file unless you log in against pwrprodn, so if you are logging against the test db's yer safe.. and for the summary to work it does require at least one previous summary detail in that excel file to work.. it uses that excel's defined macros and such to calculate the totals.. so doing a complete purge wouldnt do good.. do let me know if you have any questions about this.. be more than happy to help.regardsasemx
