just got done talking with corry, and deal scheduling showing the incorrect status of a physical routed flag is an issue. corry will proceed and test against pwrtestp on monday, no production rollouts will occur at this time.  	since we do have a major database migration process this weekend, our dba's are currently tied up and our requests for production updates to the database have been slightly postponed till next week.regardsasemx
