attached is the latest draft of the portland doorstep review.  the only open item is observation #  concerning the i/t system build for a scheduling system and the fact that the server would reside in houston (and thus, potential exposure if link between houston and portland fails).  tim belden requested that i put your names as owners.  therefore, i need for you all to give me a target date and we can revise or discuss the action step if you want.  i would like to turn in the final draft tomorrow if possible.thanks,michelle
