dear mom,i just want you to know that i love you very much.  you still mean as much to me now as ever. i am your family whether i am married to dave or not.  you are an example of kindness and giving, and one of the most special women on the planet as far as i am concerned.i have been kind of keeping quiet because i know how much dave needs you right now, and i don't want to say anything that would diminish him in your eyes. part of the reason that i waited as long as i did to do this is that i desperately wanted one last family thanksgiving where nobody has to choose who can come or feel strange or anything. dave has decided to stay with bob and sandi, and just come up to deal with the vending machines.  i am glad, things are very tense and weird.  i just want to get everything settled. he seems like he is getting angry, and i don't like that.  he told me he wants me to keep the truck instead of the car because everytime he looks at the truck he feels like it is a betrayal. i got him this truck to help him with his business. wanna buy a brand new truck?anyway,  it will all work out and we will all get thru this .  i have a new cell phone number, please feel free to call me, and i will probably call you tonight just to touch base and let you know i love you./-love,c
