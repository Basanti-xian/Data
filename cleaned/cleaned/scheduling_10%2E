will,i ran another quick test this morning (spanning  to  due to other events) for june .  the paths routed correctly and information went to the confirmation area properly.  even though i had "east power" checked in the confirmation area, all of the "west" paths also showed up too.the only error message i got involved not being able to route transmission deals.i will do a more extensive study this afternoon.cb
