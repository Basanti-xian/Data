dear little sister,thank you so much for you love and support during this difficult time.  i wish that i could make this easier on everyone, but this is what has to be done.  i have no intention of separating from you or the rich/mcphersons, you all are more than family to me.  you will always be my little sister. i am going to work very hard to come through this with dave and me as much friends as possible, so that the stress to us all will be minimized.  i see no reason to hurt people over what amounts to belongings.i am glad you liked your gifts, you did save at least one to open on christmas day, right?  i hope so.i have the house to myself this weekend, dave is at your folks to give us a little space.  he is still very upset, and i feel bad that i have made him so sad. i really didn't think he would be this upset. i am glad that the family is rallying support for him, and i have been kind of laying low with the family so that he can have that support. he has no real friends here, and that is a big problem.i love you,cara"pizza pie"
