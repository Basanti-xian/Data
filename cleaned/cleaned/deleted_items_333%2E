cara,i agree that we should reduce the number of "names" from a global standpoint now while we can.  the routing portion of the workspace seems to work well, i agree, but the major issues lie with the confirmation side of it.on another note, it seems i am duplicating work here.  ie: i am using buildroute, transferring to excel (to get the font/colors, etc) then back to the workspace.we'll see...i'll hit it again next week.thanks for all your "documented" input...it sure helps.cb
