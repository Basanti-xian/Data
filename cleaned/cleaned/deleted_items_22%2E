ray and isas -just going through the past four days of email, so please excuse thisresponse if it has been already addressed.what was said at the jan th meeting of the eswg was, i (bob harshbarger)was not prepared to address the issues surrounding voting, membership, etc.at that meeting.  eswg will have to adopt some form of structure if we are to proceed asquickly as the esc.  the eswg was formed at the direction of the jointguidance committee.  we have been asked to consider formalized or structuremembership based on the same guidelines that isas has been given.  theintent is not to leave anyone out but to ensure we can address issues in atimely manner.there is no perfect solution.  a weighted sector voting structure doesappear to give broader voice to the masses, yet even within a single sectorthe participants can opposing view points and still feel under represented.what the eswg adopts is to be seen.  robert harshbargerpuget sound energyoasis trading manager..
