hi honey,i hope you are having a good day, i sure enjoyed playing a bit this morning. (although i had a little bout of blue bush) i just love having you around all the time. i don't want turkey for dinner, and since it's payday, i wanna take us out to dinner. where would you like to go?  or we can be turds again tonight and to to yoko's tomorrow, or whatever.i am suddenly actually busy figuring out the estate vs the newcompany stuff, it is fun to be busy and needed.i love you very much and can't wait to see you tonight to show you the new license!love,cara freeland
