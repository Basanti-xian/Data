hi sweetie,hopefully the visit to the dr won't be that bad, do you want me to come hold your hand? (that would be pushing the envelope on intimacy, eh?) i saw a wrapper in the trash this morning and was sad to see it there. you need to fix that ( or those as it were). please let me know what the dr. says.the movie sounds good, but we will see how tired you are when you get home.  i wouldn't mind laying around like a turd this evening either. i need to vacuum but that is all.i love you, and am so glad that i make you happy. i want us to be happy together for many years to come. i still feel like the luckiest woman in the world, to have such a caring and loving man in my life so suddenly.see you tonight,c
