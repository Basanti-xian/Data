good morning..........sir,i am wearing my sweatshirt and my new boots to work, so my feet are warm and i feel like i have you wrapped around me. my roses are starting to really open up now, they are so beautiful.i had fun at the party last night, danced my fool head off.  good natured fun dancing with the buds from work.  one guy tried to dip me and failed miserably, i fell on my right hip, but not before i nearly knocked myself unconcious on part of the wall. i ended up sitting there for a minute with a packet of frozen soybeans on my noggin.  i told him no more of that stuff. on the way home from the party i almost just showed up at your house, but figured you needed a break from me for some rest.  you have a good day, hope you are rested and feeling good.:)
