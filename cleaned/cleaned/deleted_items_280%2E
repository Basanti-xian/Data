i ran the psw for the east (/ data)  and also had problems with each of the following:)	enter moves cell to the left) 	colors changed)	path with transmission did not go to confirmation sheet) 	physicals were noted on the confirmation strips, but not on scheduling strips)	confirmation strips were deleted, and new data added to the psw.  then, the confirmation button would not respond again.)	the first query for buildroute did not work.  second query worked ok, data could be viewed.what did work:only east power showing up!i'll be testing again today, and d. baugham will be looking at the psc this week.thanks,corry
