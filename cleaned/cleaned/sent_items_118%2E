i am so glad you got internet service at home!  earthlink is good.have a wonderful time in florida, i liked it bunches when i went.  things are strange here, dave is still very upset but is starting to trend toward anger now. he wants me to take the truck because he sees it as a betrayal that i got it for him a couple of months ago.  ok. i have a truck now and he has the car.  wanna buy a truck?  he is also not wanting to be at home, which is fine with me. it is so tense and weird right now that i am glad to have the house to myself.  i don't really want to be there either.i have been keeping busy with friends, they have been so good to me during this. i went to a seattle seahawks game yesterday at the university stadium, and thought about those trips up there to sit with you all during scotty's surgeries. seattle was nice, but it was a long day and horrbile horrible rain. our seats were in the upper stadium away from the wind so we were dry. i have a movie tomorrow and a party wednesday. tonight is just being home catching up on my laundry and my sleep.i love you very much! thanks for keeping me in your heart.cara
