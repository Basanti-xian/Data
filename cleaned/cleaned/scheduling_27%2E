steve/christian:attached is a the commercial person's attempt at an amendment to our el paso services agreement. from a legal perspective there may be a desire to make this a more legally palatable document. my advice is not to begin such an effort in futility and leave this about as plain and simple as it is. now, therefore, taking into account the preceding sentence, can legal provide an amendment that provides for the commercial terms and conditions in the attached?thanks
