regardless of your "misc mind altering" habits, i think will did say that they would only be able to have path modifications/cuts modified in the notes part initially.  then (whenever the "next" modification was implemented), they would add the capability to interact with enpower deals (ie write notes to the deal record and then, provide an entry point for deal entry for new deals done).the east group does not need to see por/pod in the path for "transmission."  my intent was to put a counterparty name in the tran name column (example: tva), and enpower deal number in tran deal#	(example: .) if available, and oasis number + level of reliability in tran oasis	 (example:   f-).  i thought the logic for "tag" and "oasis" should be a combination of text and numbers. the reasoning for border  was to have an additional border point to query for (in confirmation) when we move from one place to another. what if you put the borders in the oasis column (ie: ww/mead  f-)? the path would be: generation-marketer-e-trans(t) ww/mead  f--e-marketer-sink.gotta run,cb
