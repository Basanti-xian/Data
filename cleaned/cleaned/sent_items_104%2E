hi sweetie, i am doing fine, things are still wierd, but dave has gone to stay with his parents and only comes to town to deal with his vending machines.  i went to the law store and got all the documents, but i find them very intimidating. i think i would rather pay the single fee to the lawyer so that i know it is all done right. i would like your advice on this matter. i have been going to parties and movies and such,  having fun.  i have been on a date, and am currently enjoying the company of a man named craig. he is a very sweet man, and we have just clicked. talk to you later, have a good long weekend off. i have a new cell phone number - cara
