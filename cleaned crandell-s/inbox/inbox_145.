melba,sean sat down with christian and i and explained his proposed product.  the= product works like this:  epmi and a counterparty agree on a day-ahead bas=is to a quantity of power, a price for that power, a delivery point, and th=e hours at which the power will be scheduled.  the seller does not schedule= the power as a day-ahead schedule, however.  instead, the supplier schedul=es the power on a real time basis on the day of delivery.  i made a small m=odification to sean's proposed definition, which i think will clear up any =ambiguity.  with this change, christian and i approve of the definition of =the product.=20
