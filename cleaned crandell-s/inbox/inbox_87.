"if they had been going a slower speed, the results wouldnot have been disastrous," said bob mcnair, a houstonenergy entrepreneur who sold the bulk of his own company toenron three years ago. but enron, he said in an interviewthis month, was like a race car, and the markets like anunforgiving track. "it's a lot harder to keep it on thetrack at 200 miles per hour," he said. "you hit a bump andyou're off the track." from his youth, mr. lay, 59, had nurtured an abiding faithin the markets' wisdom. he studied economics at theuniversity of missouri, living at home to save on room andboard, and eventually earned a ph.d. in the subject. as anaval officer serving in the pentagon, he worked to developmore efficient accounting systems. later, he served as anaide to a federal government regulator for the natural gasindustry - a market that enron would come to dominate. moving into the private sector, he worked his way up theranks of the natural gas industry, becoming chief executivein 1984 of the houston natural gas corporation, a bigregional pipeline operator. he engineered its merger withinternorth, an omaha pipeline company, and then becamechief executive of the combined company and changed itsname to enron. mr. lay saw enron's mission as far more than being aconduit for fuel. at the time, gas prices were regulatedand pipelines played a relatively passive role; buyers andsellers could not cut deals on the fly. but as oil pricesplunged in the mid-80's and gas users began switching tocheaper fuel oil, mr. lay returned to washington to argue,successfully, for rules changes that he said would save thepipeline business by allowing operators to shop for thebest deals from both gas producers and utilities. the new flexibility brought the threat of chaos, however,as natural gas prices began fluctuating wildly. that iswhen the new enron was truly born. to help customers shieldthemselves from risk, mr. lay's enron developed hedgingcontracts for gas like those traded in the markets for cornand copper and winter wheat. its innovative "gas bank" letutilities lock up the long-term prices that they craved;enron lined up the gas supplies from producers, arrangedfor delivery - and took a cut of every deal. that business became the forerunner of enron's entry intohundreds of other markets, helping customers obtainsupplies and manage risks in products ranging from electricpower to pulp and paper and, most recently, fast broadbandaccess to the internet. trading soon provided more of thecompany's profits than the traditional natural gasbusiness. while other companies, including dynegy, focused onaccumulating hard assets like pipelines, turbines and gasfields, enron increasingly saw itself as a pure tradingcompany with an almost limitless future. "there is a very reasonable chance that we will become thebiggest corporation in the world," mr. lay's handpickedsuccessor as enron's chief executive, jeffrey k. skilling,told the authors of a book, just published, about businesson the internet. even the book's title, "radical e: from geto enron - lessons on how to rule the web"(pricewaterhousecoopers), showed the cachet the company hadattained. enron, the authors wrote, was "creating a culturein which radical and creative thinking is encouraged andrewarded." mr. skilling abruptly resigned in august, after just sixmonths on the job, propelling mr. lay back into the grittydetails of enron's businesses that he had sought to leaveto others. as the company grew, he had become increasingly involved inpublic affairs, serving as host when a global economicconference was held in houston in 1990 and when therepublican national convention came to the city in 1992. like the leaders of many big texas businesses - theconstruction colossus brown & root after world war ii orross perot's electronic data systems in the 1960's - mr.lay knew the value of courting politicians and policymakers. he played golf with president bill clinton; became goodfriends with the texas governor, ann richards; andsupported senator phil gramm of texas, whose wife, wendy, aformer chairwoman of the commodities futures tradingcommission, joined enron's board. "he's a stand-up guy," said ms. richards, now a businessconsultant in new york. asked to be more specific, shesaid, "he's at the meeting" - meaning she could count onmr. lay to become directly involved with whatever she askedhim to do, and not just sign onto a project for show. mr. lay's deepest political ties were with the bush family.in the 1980's, he became a major fund-raiser for george h.w. bush. when mr. bush lost his 1992 campaign for re-election as president, mr. lay brought a number of seniorbush aides to enron as directors or consultants, includingjames a. baker iii, the former secretary of state, androbert a. mosbacher, the former secretary of commerce. mr. lay also cultivated mr. bush's son george w. longbefore he was considered a serious national candidate.after the younger mr. bush's election as texas governor in1994, mr. lay became head of the governor's businesscouncil, an important advisory post. the bond with president bush is personal. as governor, mr.bush sent mr. lay a kidding note in 1997. "one of the sadthings about old friends is that they seem to be gettingolder - just like you!" he wrote. "55 years old. wow! thatis really old. thank goodness you have such a young,beautiful wife," he added, a reference to mr. lay's wife,linda. in 1999, mr. lay sent a handwritten christmas note to mr.bush and his wife, laura. "linda and i are so proud of bothof you and look forward to seeing both of you in the whitehouse," he wrote. yesterday, the white house press secretary, ari fleischer,said the treasury department was monitoring enron'sdownfall for its effect on the market. asked if thepresident himself had any reaction, mr. fleisher said, "thepresident's reaction is that it should be monitored." in some ways, enron's collapse was one more example of thebursting of the internet bubble. but mr. lay was not somestylish dot-com brat; by all accounts, he is an immenselylikable product of middle america. growing up in tiny rushhill, mo., he was driving a tractor by age 12 and saltingaway savings. by 16, his sister sharon recalled this week,"he was bucking bales" - that is, loading hay - "and hadtwo jobs in the summer, painting houses." "i don't think you could ever say that he did something theeasy way," she said. that work ethic ran in the family. mr. lay's father was aminister who also sold farm equipment. the family'sfinances were spotty, "at times no money, at times somemoney," ms. lay recalled. still, the lays took in peoplefrom their church who were in need. over the last decade or so, mr. lay earned some $300million from enron, mostly by exercising stock options.earlier this month, when employees grew incensed at theprospect of his collecting a big severance package with thecompany's sale to dynegy, he volunteered to walk away from$60 million in payments. mr. mcnair, the houston entrepreneur, who has known mr. layfor years, suggested that perhaps everything had not beendisclosed to him. "maybe the people who reported to himtold him what they wanted him to hear, but they weren'ttelling him everything," he said. mr. mcnair said he spoke to mr. lay recently and found him"somewhat in a state of shock." mr. mcnair added, "he'sdevastated." in the end, it seems, the man whose company did so much tohelp others manage their risk could not manage his own. http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/29/business/29lay.html?ex=1008076920&ei=1&en=edb180383864356bhow to advertise---------------------------------for information on advertising in e-mail newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with the new york times on the web, please contact alyson racer at alyson@nytimes.com or visit our online media kit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfofor general information about nytimes.com, write to help@nytimes.com.  copyright 2001 the new york times company
