diana -  i have the following charges on bpa's revised final bills and was wondering if you could tell me who's books these should go on?  october 2000	  $ 3,214  february 2001   $ 4,153  i spoke with corrine surface at bpa and learned that these charges are being applied given the following situation:  on october 10, 2000 and february 1, 5, and 6, 2001, our real-time group called bpa to reserve transmission for some schedules.  our r-t guys requested tranny using account numbers (such as 794811) that were for day-ahead firm transmission, thus entering the field of unauthorized increase charges (incurred at $12,000/mwh) .  since bpa did not go over the structure of the product in that account, they are not going to charge us the $12,000 per mwh, but since we did get firm transmission, we will have to pay the $59/mwh for the firm; hence the above charges.  i understand that you have also spoken with corrine at bpa and were going to talk to bill.  can you let me know where these charges need to go?   (bill - diana is out this week, so if you have already talked to her about this, please let me know)  thanks,    virginia
