hi sean,i'm trying to understand the mechanics of this product. if i understand cor=rectly the only difference between day ahead and the dart product is that i=t does not get scheduled for delivery until the delivery day. also a dart t=rade for the 3rd would mean delivery for all peak hours on the 3rd?savita
