this rehearing order is huge, and i will not attempt to comprehensively sum=marize it.   however, here are my top 9 findings of interest to epmi/oldco/=newco and marketers in general.  given that current prices are well below t=he cap, many of these ferc findings regarding prospective mitigation are ir=relevant from a commercial standpoint. (but will become important if the ma=rket turns up before 9/30/01.)there will be many more general summaries in the trade press.  for a starte=r, i recommend reading gary ackerman's (attached).=201. the underscheduling penalty has been completely eliminated retroactively=.  the ious and eob won 100% here.  thus epmi's $30 million non-invoiced cr=edit is kaput unless we appeal the ferc decision.2. ferc affirms mitigation applies only to spot transactions and not to for=ward contracts.  this comes up in several places in the order (e.g., see p.= 52 and 55) and is useful in or defense against spp/npc complaints.3. on the refund side, marketers and hydro owners may show that refunds do =not cause net negative revenues (p. 49; see also p. 169)" ?the commission will provide an opportunity after the conclusion of the r=efund hearing for marketers to submit cost evidence on the impact of the re=fund methodology on their overall revenues over the refund period. for the =commission to consider any adjustments, marketers will have to demonstrate =that the refund methodology results in a total revenue shortfall for all ju=risdictional transactions during the refund period. the commission will con=sider such submissions in light of the regulatory principle that sellers ar=e guaranteed only an opportunity to make a profit. to the extent we stated =in the july 25 order that we would not allow such a showing regarding selle=rs' purchased power costs,131 we grant rehearing. we will also allow seller=s of hydroelectric power to demonstrate the impact of the refund methodolog=y. "4. caiso is required to submit a comprehensive congestion management redesi=gn and plans for a day-ahead energy market by may 1, 2002.  this is a good =requirement because it gives ferc cover to not extend mitigation past 9/30/=02.  caiso must have known this is coming since it is already circulating a= proposal.=205. government agency exemptions.  the ferc was firm that government entitie=s and rus-financed cooperatives are not exempt from the mitigation and refu=nd requirements if the power was sold to one of the ferc-approved markets; =namely, the caiso's r/t market and the px day-ahead market.  however, ferc =granted rehearing of government entity requests to be exempt from the west-=wide cap.  thus, government entities are now exempt from the wscc wide cap!=  however, marketers cannot resell government generated power  above the ca=p.  the key difference is that government agencies selling power outside th=e caiso are not necessarily using a ferc- regulated market.6. no special treatment for vertically integrated utilities acting as marke=ters (p. 88)=20"we will not allow lses to justify sales above the mitigated market clearin=g prices based on their cost of purchased power."7. enron wins on certainty of price in mitigated ancillary service markets.=  in one of the few places a rehearing was granted, ferc approved enron's r=equest to make the cap binding at the time the deal is consummated, not whe=n power flows (p. 94):"the iso, enron and reliant seek some type of ex ante pricing. the iso prop=oses that prices in the ancillary services capacity markets in all hours in=cluding system emergency hours be limited to 85 percent of the most recentl=y established mitigated reserve deficiency mcp, asserting that such an appr=oach is more consistent with the commission's intention to set prices befor=e they are charged. while enron and reliant also seek a price that is known= before the price is charged and that will not change, that price would not= be capped. this topic is addressed in the order on the iso's compliance fi=lings that is being issued concurrently with this order. as we explain in t=hat order, changes in the mitigated reserve deficiency mcp for the imbalanc=e energy market should have no effect on prices in the ancillary services m=arkets. thus, we agree with enron and reliant that the price for the hour a= transaction is entered into, and not the hour of delivery, is relevant for= establishing the market-clearing price for ancillary services. we will gra=nt rehearing of our prior orders on this point, to the extent needed to all=ow this modification."however, epmi asked for similar certainty in the mitigated market price in =the r/t energy market  (p. 62).  ferc raised the question but i could not f=ind a response. (?)8. marketers (still) cannot sell above the cap. marketers were denied rehea=ring in several places (e.g., p. 46).  marketers cannot be treated like gen=erators even if they own or control generation.  in one of the more ambiguo=us passages:"the commission denies clarification that marketers that own or control gen=eration and engage in marketing through a portfolio of resources, or that p=erform scheduling or tolling functions on behalf of generators, will be tre=ated as generators; they must be price takers. by contrast, entities that a=re able to trace a transaction to a specific generating unit will be treate=d as generators. with respect to calpine's request for clarification, the c=ommission will require marketing affiliates of generators to be price taker=s. furthermore, marketer-to-marketer transactions in the bilateral spot mar=ket are subject to price mitigation and marketers selling outside of the is=o's single price auction will receive the price up to the mitigated market =clearing price."i am not sure how the second sentence jives with the first.  if market pric=es rise, we will need to research this issue.9. option contracts are forward sales (yeah, we won!) (p. 152):"similarly, with respect to enron's request for clarification that option a=greements exercised for spot-market sales are not themselves spot-market sa=les, we clarify that such sales are entered into for future periods and the=refore are not subject to mitigation."
