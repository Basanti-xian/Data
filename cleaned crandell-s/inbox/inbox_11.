sean,here's the url:     http://ebusiness.henwoodenergy.comlogin name: timmyhpassword: humptydumpty(never let julie sarnowski set up passwords for you)this will get you access to multiple henwood services. the one that gives the plant performance stats is genreporter, and you navigate it more or less the same way that you use our plant database: dropdown lists subset the plants by region, owner, type, etc. once you see a list of plants, click on unit name for more data.please call if you have problems,tim
