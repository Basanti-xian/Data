today, enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =of the company. here's an update of what we discussed during the call.we told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=ests and to regain their confidence. our focus remains on our credit qualit=y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.it took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. here's a snapshot =of significant events that led to our current situation:-- in hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=re businesses over the past several years. those include investments in azu=rix, india and brazil. they have performed far worse that we could have eve=r imagined when we made these investments;-- because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=ny. the negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;-- we also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;-- we've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=stand financial and operating disclosures; and-- on top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=iscussed in our 8-k filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=usly reported earnings.we've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three= areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.core businessesour core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=nings and cash flows for the company. they're our competitive advantage. th=ese include:-- natural gas pipeline businesses;-- gas and power businesses in north america and europe;-- retail businesses in north america and europe; and-- coal businesses in north america and europe.the events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=r projected fourth quarter profitability. it's too early to tell at this ti=me what impact this might have on our operating results. we are considering= these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=.i also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =concerns. according to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=mprovement in our counterparty relationships.non-core businessesour non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=ivision. we have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the= return from them has been dismal.we have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash= that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. we alre=ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. th=ey include ceg rio, a gas ldc in brazil; ecoelectrica, a power plant and ln=g receiving terminal in puerto rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=s properties in india. the approximately $2.9 billion portland general sale= is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.businesses under reviewthese businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. while sev=eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make= reductions to our work force. more information will follow as soon as it b=ecomes available.credit rating/10-q filingwe continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. our current cr=edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:-- moody's at baa3       "under review for further downgrade"-- fitch at bbb-             "evolving status"-- s&p at bbb-              "creditwatch negative"we also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including osprey, marlin= and yosemite, in further detail. we told investors that we will file our 1=0-q five days late due to our current activities. it will be filed on nov. =19.we will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=ll as our frequent updates with you. the full transcript of our conference =call will be filed with the securities and exchange commission in the next =few days. it will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=stors under "sec filings."=20=20in connection with the proposed transactions, dynegy and enron will file a =joint proxy statement/prospectus with the securities and exchange commissio=n. investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes= available, because it will contain important information. investors and se=curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =dynegy and enron, without charge, at the sec's web site at www.sec.gov. cop=ies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the sec filings that will b=e incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may als=o be obtained for free by directing a request to either: investor relations=, dynegy inc., 1000 louisiana, suite 5800, houston, tx 77002, phone: (713) =507-6466, fax: (713) 767-6652;
