all:we (epmi) has requested to be on this ferc workshop agenda.  i am interested in rebutting the presumption that when a cold wave comes to pnw that prices only rise in that region. i may need some help pulling some data showing that prices are correlated throughout the region.  thus if you do not raise cap region wide (or assure export capacity through caiso) you won't get the power to where its needed.alan
