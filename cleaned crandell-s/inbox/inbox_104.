last night our main 'server' failed, and we have been working since to restore service. it looks like we lost no data for the time, you cannot get to your h:, p:, w:, r: (local drives) i have no eta. you will have trouble starting some programs. terminal server is unaffected: houston based data is unaffected: i will follow up with more news / details later victor and paul are available to help get you with anything we can. thank you for your patience dave
