commenting on his general perception of the settlement conference, the chie=f judge, in his down home manner, did not miss the opportunity to say that ="you can take a horse to water but you can't make him drink."  below is a c=liff notes version of the judge's report and recommendation issued at 4:49 =pm today.  attached is the complete work. =20the judge opined that very large refunds would be due- "while the amount of= such refunds is not $8.9 billion as claimed by the state of california, th=ey do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, probably more than a billi=on dollars in an aggregate sum.  ?at the same time, while there are vast su=ms due for overcharges, there are even larger amounts owed to energy seller=s by the caiso, the investor owned utilities, and the state of california. = can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller=?  the chief judge thinks not."  another notable quote:  "?it is the opinio=n of the chief judge that the amount claimed by the state of california has= not and cannot be substantiated." =20the judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on july 5, which wa=s summarily rejected by the state of california, and that the five separate= offers of the various industry groups to settle with california were also =rejected.=20 =20refund effective date- refund effective date of october 2, 2000, for sales =in the spot markets of the caiso and the cal px.  the chief judge's recomme=ndations do not go beyond that date.  "spot market" sales are "sales that a=re 24 hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to de=livery."=20evidentiary hearing- "the differences between what the state of california =believes the buyers in the california markets are owed in refunds and what =the sellers in the california market believe should be refunded raise mater=ial issues of fact. the appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds =involve factual disputes.  thus, the chief judge recommends that a trial-ty=pe, evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to =the methodology set forth below.  because of the urgent need for an answer =to the refund issues that hearing should be on a 60-day fast track schedule=.  it is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating pot=ential refunds in this proceeding.  however, such a methodology may not be =appropriate for all sellers in the caiso's and cal px's spot markets in an =after-the-fact refund calculation.    in any event, sellers not using the m=ethodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceede=d the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund =period."methodology- the chief judge recommends that the methodology set forth in t=he june 19th order be used with the modifications discussed below in order =to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the cais=o's and cal px's spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period o=ctober 2, 2000 through may 28, 2001. =20heat rate- the actual heat rates, rather than hypothetical heat rates (asso=ciated with recreating the must-bid requirement of the june 19th order) pro=vide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit.gas cost-  the gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based =upon a daily spot gas price.  "in the event that the marginal unit is locat=ed in np15 (north of path 15), the daily spot gas price for pg&e citygate a=nd malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the =marginal unit's heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour.  if =the marginal unit is located in sp15 (south of path 15), the daily spot gas= price for southern california gas large packages should be multiplied by t=he marginal unit's heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour.  =the daily spot gas prices should be for the "midpoint" as published in fina=ncial times energy's "gas daily" publication for the aforementioned deliver=y points.  the last published gas prices should be used in calculating the =refund price for the days that gas daily is not published (weekends and hol=idays)."=20o&m adder-  an adder of $6/mwh for o&m should also be included with the cal=culated market clearing price. =20emissions costs- demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the ma=rket clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may s=ubtract from their respective refund calculation.credit adder- the 10 percent adder should be included in the market clearin=g price for all transactions that occurred after january 5, 2001 when pg&e =and socal edison were deemed no longer creditworthy.ancillary services-  consistent with the june 19th order, ancillary service= prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the rea=l-time imbalance energy market.  adjustment bids would also be treated the =same as set forth in the june 19th order.=20maximum price for non-emergency hours- somewhat unclear.  the chief judge r=ecommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculat=ing refunds, the refund methodology should deviate from the 85% non-emergen=cy requirement of the june 19th order.  to measure the amount that actual p=rices may have exceeded the refund price, every hour should be recalculated=.offsets-  "recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a ref=und calculation would also permit the cal px and caiso to resettle all char=ges for the refund period.  amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts= due from buyers would be recalculated.  any refunds could then be offset a=gainst accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their= purchases from the caiso and cal px during the refund period."interest-  interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless= the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller.
