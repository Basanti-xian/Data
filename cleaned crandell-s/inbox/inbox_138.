all: i recommend this presentation to traders and other folks who are involved with transmission and/or market structures.  it is more likley (although far off) that the rto west may move to a locational (nodal) marginal pricing (lmp) model, akin to the way pjm operates.  andy ott is a key manager at pjm and this is a unique opportunity to hear how that system operates from someone who has direct experience. please let me know if you will go.  i will be going and cam offer to drive. alan comnes
