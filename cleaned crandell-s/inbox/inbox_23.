sean, as you have probably hear, i am not going to be with  ubs, which is both a disappointment and a blessing, perhaps better things await me elsewhere.  while i have tried to convince myself of this, it is difficult to truly accept.  i just wanted to let you know how much i have enjoyed working with you, even if only for a short time.  hopefully i will be able to stay on with the estate for a while, while things are being settled and i make some decisions regarding the direction of my career.  i should be in the office tomorrow and next week, perhaps we could chat, if you have any advice for me, i will gladly take it.  best regards, serena
