tonight, all 1-month west power products will be un-tokenized.  this means they will no longer roll automatically on the last day of the month (on october 1st, your november product will not change to december, but will remain november).  please contact us should you have any questions.chris walker	713-853-7533kevin meredith	713-853-9555melba lozano	713-345-8986
