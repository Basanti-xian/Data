sean,enclosed is a proposed methodology for the dow jones hourly index.  ourlonger term goal is to have this information posted to a website andavailable on an hourly basis, with perhaps a 2 or so hour delay.  that willtake longer to implement and some firms have expressed reservation withreceiving the information too early.  presently, our goal is to have thisinformation available to traders via email by 5:00 a.m. pt.  this ispreliminary and your thoughts and comments would be appreciated.cheers,ernest onukoguenergy servicesdow jones & companyp.o.box 300princeton, n.j. 08543-0300609 520-4663 <<paloverdehourly-def.doc>>
