dear sean,  i have changed 2 deals that were put in as transmission sales : deals # 894692 and 894962 to buy resales.  please make any adjustments necessay to your scheduling sheets, etc.  the new b/r deal numbers are 896676.1 and 896677.1 respectively, to replace the above 2 deals.  the reason for this change is that the business rules of enpower will not allow the system to recognize a sale of transmission from epmi to another counterparty.    please contact me with any questions you may have.    thanks,  virginia
