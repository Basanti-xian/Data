kroum has developed a new forward obligation report, which will allow us to capture all term deals, desk-to-desk and all scheduling changes.  both heather dunton and i have tested it in stage and will be pushed out to production soon.  once i have the date i will forward it to all of you.  it should be within the next couple of days.  i will also show all of you how to run the report to capture the criteria we need to do our swaps.diana
