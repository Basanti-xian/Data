diana- fyi - i won't know when we will be done with all variances until settlements can tell me with 100% accuracy that we still have these variances outstanding.  (the reason we don't know for sure is that settlements issues come back again and again and we change some numbers and the cp changes some numbers, etc.)the answer depends on our cross-check with max at scl.  max will be out until 8-30-01.  let me know if you need this escalated and we will contact someone else at scl. for my personal information, what kind of time line do you have?virginia
