diana:today i reviewed ncpa related deals for 11/1-11/6 and found:11/1 => good11/2 => somehow the lightload sale side (deal 517676.1) is only showing he1-he6 in the scheduling system now.  i wonder if someone deleted he23-he24 afterwards (*on the lightload purchase side we have both he1-he6 and he23-he24, deal 517673.1).  11/3 => good11/4 => annuity missing (no power delievered)11/5 => annuity missing (no power delievered)11/6 => annuity missing (no power delievered)please let me know if you could restore the he23-he24 for 11/2 back in the scheduling system if they should be there, also please let me know when the missed annuities are entered.  i have also attached my worksheet for your convenient reference. thanks,fran changwest power risk management503.464.7973 (phone)503.464.3740 (fax)
