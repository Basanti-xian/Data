diana, good question.  i have asked chuck dial (6-345-3486) in it enpower group earlier this month when i spotted that the records are different and he advised this looks like a one time mess up.  we couldn't find the reason but yes ideally they should synchronize.  remember earlier this month we had some fsp issues, and chuck was wondering if that's associated but we could not be sure.  he ran some testing in the back end afterwards and every test showed synchronized results.  therefore for this ncpa buy/resale deal we'll have to manually zero out the volume in view actuals to make it right. -fran
