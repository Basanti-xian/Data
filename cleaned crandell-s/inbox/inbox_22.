dear amy,  my apologies that it has taken me a day or two to respond about the december 2001 checkout.  i have spoken with our traders and learned that the reason epmi deals # 585276.1 and 585277.1 are not in the system beyond december 2, 2001 is because (due to bankruptcy proceedings), modesto irrigation district requested termination of our contract on december 2, 2001.  i understand that there was physical delivery every day of the month and i am working with our teams to get this in our system correctly.  please call me if you have any questions.  i will send you an email when this has been finished.  thanks,   virginia
