attached is the latest draft of the sc roles matrix that we handed out yesterday.  the major changes are indicated by bolding in the "customer type" column.  as mentioned yesterday, we are still considering the request for the bpa sc to take on the sc role for slicers load, so no change has been made to those items at this time.
