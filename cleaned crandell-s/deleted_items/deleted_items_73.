chuck   don't know if this will reach you.  i tried to reach you on your work number   but the vmail never "beeps" to leave a message.  with the   situation at enron, i was thinking of your situation.  if i can be of   any help, pls let me know as i have some experience in the search area (if   applicable).  in any event, it would be good to hear from  you.  i really   appreciated the help you had given to me.   john lewis   312.853.1372
