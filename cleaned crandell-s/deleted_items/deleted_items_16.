mo,the estate has a valuable transmission contract with pge (between mid-c and cob).  we (you) get billed once an month and need to make sure the estate pays this promptly.  pge has been given your name as the poc.  i treat this like a power contract and make sure houston wires the money as soon as we get an invoice.steve
