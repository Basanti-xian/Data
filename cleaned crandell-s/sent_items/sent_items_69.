in case you don't, hey what's going on?  i haven't talked with you in a long time, so i was wondering what's up with you?  how's dc?  how's pge?  i'm doing ok.  i went to europe in june (whole month).  very nice.  italy, switzerland, france, and netherlands.  hard to come back.  then i almost went to duke, but then came to agreement with enron.  that was interesting.  anyway, just wanted to touch base.  let me know what's going on.sean
