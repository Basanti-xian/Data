hey,you sound kind of bummed out there, amiga.  understandable though.  tough and very weird times that's for sure.  very sad.  the funerals must have been brutal.  i know i'm depressed by it because i get these waves of sadness that hit me out of the blue periodically.  hopefully things will improve.our stock has just been munched.  it sucks because we're doing well, but the other "half" of the company appeared to be mostly smoke and mirrors.  everyone was wondering why skilling left; i guess we know why now.enough of the gloom and doom.  sounds like you are getting opportunities--that's good.  i knew that you would.  here's some pros/cons for your options (recalling my vast experience;))  structuring:  interesting but not alot of dough.  probably the most easily replaced by those fresh mbas.  trading:  like being handcuffed to a schizophrenic on speed.  can turn you into a frothing mass of neurosis at times.  good dough if you make it though.  marketing:  low immediate, constant stress, but still competitive.  you have a great deal of charm and brains, so i think you would do quite well in this area.  in addition, there are a number of firms (calpine, aep, coral) who are opening up an office in portland pretty much geared towards mid-marketing.  might be opportunity down the road for you to move closer to home (plus you can buy me beer, which is always a plus for anyone's karma).as far as your overall attitude towards the industry, i think i disagree.  i think it's a good industry to be in, particularly now, because no matter what, people need electricity.  and it's still changing, especially out west, so there will be challenges and opportunities.it's great talking with you.  cheer up.  call your folks.  run.  punch a punching bag.  do drugs (kidding).  take care of yourself, and if you need anything, give me a buzz or drop an email.sean
