kevin,my apologies for not getting back sooner, but i sort of wanted to see how t=he enron real-time products did before proceeding with this.  it seems like= real-time is a success, so let's get going with this. =20i call this product dart (day-ahead/real-time).  it's basically a physical =product that is transacted on a day-ahead cash basis, but is delivered on r=eal-time.  for example, on the day-ahead, lets say i post a "us pwr phy fir=m  mid-c peak oct04 to oct05 dart"  $27 at $28.  if i get hit, then the par=ty selling to me is obligated to deliver on oct 5th, real-time 25 mw each h=our.  i would be long real-time at $27.  if a party lifts my $28, then i wo=uld be obligated to deliver to them on oct 5, real-time, 25 mw each hour.  =i would be short at $28.the mechanics of this deal are much like a regular day-ahead cash transacti=on.  the primary difference is we would have to flag these deals somehow su=ch that they would not get mixed with our regular day-ahead transactions th=at needed to be prescheduled.as far as the product language goes, i think if you add the following langu=age to what you provided below, we should be ok (obviously subject to legal= review)."this product is intended to be transacted on a day-ahead basis, for delive=ry on a real-time basis.  day ahead means the trading day prior to the day =of delivery, consistent with wscc scheduling and trading practices.  real-t=ime means the actual delivery day.  real-time deliveries shall be consisten=t with generally accepted wscc scheduling timelines and practices."take a look, give me a call.  thanks.
