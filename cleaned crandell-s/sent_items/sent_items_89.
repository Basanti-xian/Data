on august 16, 2001, enron counsel in dc requested that the enron northwest cash desk pull together a tremendous amount of data for part of the 2001 operating year.  the data request was unusual in the type of information it asked for, and for the most part, enron's internal systems did not track the information in the format requested.  since the pending lawsuit involves a large amount of money, it was imperative that (1) the data be pulled together, even though our internal systems did not track this type of information in a format that was readily accessible; (2) the data be as accurate as possible, and; (3) it be done in a very short period of time.the amount of data we were asked to review and pull together was massive.  utilizing cara's comprehensive, and fairly unique understanding of our scheduling and accounting systems, we were able to accomplish this task.  there were many instances where we hit a "brick wall".  specifically, it was difficult to match information from our scheduling dataset with our accounting dataset, although it was imperative we do so.  cara was instrumental in bridging this gap.as a result of her efforts, we were able to hand a quality set of data to our consultants in dc, and subsequently for our ferc filing.  i recommend that cara receive a personal best award for the amount of $2,000.sean crandall(amy.  is this good enough?)
