here are my comments1.  i wouldn't agree the caps have hurt liquidity.  in fact, in the northwe=st at least, they have actually increased liquidity.  any decrease in liqui=dity can be attributed primarily to a couple of things (1) uncertainty abou=t the level of the cap and (2) when the day-ahead prices trade above the ca=p (removing marketers as sellers).i would propose the following cap timelines.  first of all, i think it's im=portant that ferc realize the "spot" market really is two separate markets,= what we call the "day-ahead" cash markets, and "day-of" real-time markets.=  the 24-hour designation doesn't dovetail with the current market timeline=s and is a source of confusion that can adversely affect liquidity and disp=atch of power plants.  for example, day-ahead cash typically trades from 6:=00 am to approximately 7:00 am for next day deliveries.  however, on thursd=ays the wscc otc market trades for friday and saturday deliveries, and on f=ridays, we trade for sunday and monday (all of this can be adjusted for var=ious reasons, but this is the typical schedule).  if we held to the 24-hour= spot cap literally, then tuesday thru friday the cap would apply to the da=y-ahead market, but would not apply to saturday and monday.  this obviously= cannot be an intended consequence.  i recommend the cap timeline be consis=tent with the day-ahead wscc otc trading timelines.in addition, there is some question with respect to what cap applies to the= day-ahead market.  what if the forecast calls for much higher temperatures= and it is assured that real-time markets will be trading above the 85% thr=eshold?  assume that stage i, ii or even iii is a certainty.  it seems prud=ent that a higher day-ahead price cap be established (still consistent with= ferc's guidelines).  why?  because you would want units prescheduled to ha=ve high reserve margins going into real-time, rather than scrambling to dis=patch units real-time.  it seems like it would be prudent for some independ=ent board to set the day-ahead price cap equal to either the 85% or stage i= limit prior to trading time.  this board would have to have regional repre=sentatives in order to be truly effective.  establishing the cap does not h=ave to be cumbersome or time consuming, in fact, it should be fairly easy.the cap governing real-time transactions is clear.  however, what isn't cle=ar is what happens when the new stage i cap is actually lower than the exis=ting 85% of stage i cap.  for example, during the first couple of days in j=uly the real-time cap was operating under the 85% of stage 1 criteria, appr=oximately $92.  the iso hit a stage i and stage ii and the price actually f=ell to the $70s.  this created uncertainty exactly when it shouldn't happen=.  as a result supply was apparently affected in california and the southwe=st for a few hours across the peak.  it seems odd that prices should fall r=eal-time as reserve margins decrease.  one could argue this is a good reaso=n why caps should be tied to daily gas prices, but assuming that isn't an o=ption, i propose something like this:  the day before (around 2200) the cai=so, or preferably an independent body, would determine the real-time non-st=age cap as well as a stage minimum.  while in a stage i, ii, or iii the hou=rly price would be the higher of the non-stage price cap or the recalculate=d stage price.  if the stage i price turned out lower, then the non-stage p=rice would be used for that hour, but the recalculated stage i cap (and cor=responding 85% price) would apply for the next operating day, and for day-a=head cash trading for the next trade day.  this provides information before= the trading period (enhancing liquidity) and eliminates strange price move=ments during real-time.  it also fits the ferc price cap paradigm.2.  marketer prices.  i think there is a clear bias against marketers in th=e order.  but given the fact it seems deliberately slanted against marketer=s, there are clearly three areas where marketers should be allowed to recov=er costs that are easily demonstrable.  first would be losses at a tie into= california.  if we sell at the cap and incurr losses, then we can't sell a=t the cap.  second would be the 10% credit premium.  credit issues apply wh=ether you're a marketer or generator.  third would be call options.  it see=ms if the market trades above the cap and above the strike in a call option=, that a party should be able to exercise and sell.  i'm not sure what the =difference between a peaking plant and a call option is.
