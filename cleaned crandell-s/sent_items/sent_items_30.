yesterday i talked with chelan's trader and she informed me they regard the 7 mw we are delivering to them as a "good" contract.  so long as we are able to deliver, they will accept deliveries.  i'm not sure what this means in light of their termination status, but since the price is $34, i'm going to deliver until i hear otherwise.sean
