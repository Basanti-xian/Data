bruce,the 600k is salary, and nonperformance related bonus payouts.  it is not guaranteed bonus over and above salary (i wish it was).  basically, i am 95% certain i will make a minimum of 600k/year with either company, worst case i'm looking at 500k/year (excluding incentive).  incentive would be in addition to.  my offer would have to be in that ballpark.  if i worked 1/3 the year, assuming a base salary in the 250 to 300 range, i would get 100 less.  also, i'm not trying to be vague.  essentially i'm working with 3 moving parts--non of which has become crystal clear yet.  at this point, let's look at this:  2-year contract with an out after 1-year.  $275 base salary.  $225 signing bonus.  $225 retention bonus after 1-year.  if i take it, i'm done for another year.  participation in the 17% incentive package.  relocation package.  that seems to be the ballpark we are in.thanks,sean
