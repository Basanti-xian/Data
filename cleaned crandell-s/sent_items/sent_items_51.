audrey,here is a brief personal work history.  i've been in the utility industry pretty much since 1988.  i started trading for portland general electric in 1995.  i've been a trader for enron for the last 4 years.  i run enron's short-term northwest book.  i have market-making responsibility for the cash, balance, and prompt months for the mid-columbia and cob specifically, although i am responsible for the entire northwest.  i also trade palo verde, sp15, and np15.i have recently talked with a couple of other trading outfits out west and generally the structure looks something like this:1.  150 k base salary2.  250 to 300 k signing bonus3.  various bonus structures, generally with a minimum guaranteed equal to the base salary.quite frankly a move to the east coast is not very appealing.  the compensation package would have to be very attractive for me to seriously consider a move to that area.  if you have any questions, please let me know.thanks,sean crandall
