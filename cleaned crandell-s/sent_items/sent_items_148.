kevinthis looks like it will work.  since there has been some confusion around this, i'll lay out what i think will happen with this language.assumption #1:mc on eol is 300 at 350.cob is not displayed on eol.product 1 is cob; product 2 is mccob/mc spread is 5 @ 10 on eolsituation #1customer lifts the cob/mc spread at $10.  enron will then buy the mc at $325 and sell cob at $335.situation #2customer hits the cob/mc spread at $5.  enron will then sell the mc at $325 and buy cob at $329.this is how it should work.i suggest we test things out now, and see how it works.thanks,sean
