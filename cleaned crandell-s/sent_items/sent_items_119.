steve,thanks for the dinner and chance to meet everyone friday.  it actually was a pleasure to talk with nancy (rare, i think for an interview situation).i'm sorry to say i'm still in a holding pattern.  there are a couple of bits of information i still need to process, but i thought i would email you with some initial numbers.  i'd also like to confirm my understanding of duke's compensation program.base salary:  $150k-$175k/yearlti:  100% of base salary paid out in options that vest 1/3 every year.performance incentive:  2x to 6x base salary.no contract.  full relocation package.this is what i recall from the interview.  if i'm wrong, i'd appreciate clarification.regardless of what happens, i appreciate your time and consideration.  i should be able to come to a decision next week.thanks,sean
