hi there,thanks for the note.  it is very weird for sure.  i never thought it would happen to enron.  one of the reasons i didn't go to a smaller shop, even though i was offered more money, was because i didn't want to deal with crap like this.  lo and behold.  life is strange.  anyway, at this point it looks like dynegy is the suitor for the big e.  i think it will happen.  the question will become, where are we going to be located?  fortunately, i only have about 8 months left in my contract, so i won't have to put up with too much crap for too long.  we'll see.italy is awesome.  really really is.  i realize it more and more since i came back.  tuscany is so cool.  if you go there, go to san quirico, montecino and montepulciano.  very cool little towns and good wine.  florence is very cool as well.  i may go back there for a month or so this june if things aren't to wacky.  have a good time there; i'm envious.sounds like you are doing better.  also sounds like work is fun and challenging.  so do you think you are going to stay there for a while?  do you miss the west?  i don't think i'll live east of the rockies, but you never know.well, it looks like this year might be as interesting as last.  i keep thinking things will mellow out a little, but things keep getting more and more strange.it was great to hear from you and take care of yourself!sean
