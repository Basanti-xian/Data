kevin,here are the examples we talked aboutassumptions:1.  eol and broker market:  cob $30 @ $40.2.  we put out a cob/mc market $4 at $7.3.  in eol, product 1 = cob and product 2 = mc.here's what will happen in the broker market:(a) if someone hits my bid of $4 in the broker market i will buy cob at something like $35, and i will sell mid-c at $31.(b) if someone lifts my offer of $7 in the broker market i will sell cob at something like $35, and i will buy mid-c at $28.if you take the same assumptions and show this market on eol, here's my understanding of what will happen:(c) if someone hits my bid of $4 on eol, i will sell cob at $35, and i will buy mc at $39 (compare this with (a))(d) if someone lifts my offer of $7 on eol, i will buy cob at $35, and i will sell mc at $42 (compare this with (b)).clearly this doesn't work.one possible solution, i think, is to examine what happens if you put out a cob/mc product on eol, but switch the products such that product 1 = mc and product 2 = cob, and assume we put the underlying product 1 market out as mc $30 @ $40.(e)  if someone hits my bid of $4 on eol, i will sell mc at $35, and i will buy cob at $39 (achieves same result as (a), which is what we want).(f)  if someone lifts my offer of $7 on eol, i will buy mc at $35, and i will sell cob at $42 (achieves the same result as (b), which is what we want).i realize (e) and (f) don't jive with our long contract description, but conceptually it works.if you have any questions, let me know.
