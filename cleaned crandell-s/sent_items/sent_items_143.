bruce,i haven't had an opportunity to call you directly yet, so i thought i would e-mail you first and sort of lay out the circumstances.i've been a short-term trader with enron for about 4 years -- i run our short-term northwest book.  prior to that, i cash traded for portland general for a couple of years.  my contract with enron is up july 31, and i have a 3-month non-compete obligation.  theoretically, the earliest i could leave enron would be may 31, so the earliest i could start with another shop would be sept 1.to be honest, at this point i'm shopping.  i'm talking to a couple of other outfits and i basically want to see what sort of interest there is out there.  i talked with matt, and he mentioned you, so i thought it might be a good idea to get in touch.  if you are interested in pursuing anything further, please e-mail me and we'll arrange a time we can talk over the phone.thanks,sean
