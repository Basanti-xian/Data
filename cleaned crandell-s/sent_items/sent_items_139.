seems like one or each desk could participate.  the problem would be the unrecorded line.to:	mark fischer/pdx/ect@ect, tom alonso/pdx/ect@ect, jeff richter/hou/ect@ect, sean crandall/pdx/ect@ectcc:	 subject:	morning gas calla few weeks ago lavorato requested that the west power desk sit in on his morning meeting with the different desk heads.  i suggested that one of the cash traders sit in on the meeting as you guys have the best handle on what is likely to happen in the short term markets and you guys are always here at 5:45.  jeff richter has been sitting in on these meetings for the last couple of weeks.  i don't care how you guys handle it.  i originally thought that rotating between you guys might make sense.  these calls should be made on a regular line that is not recorded.  let me know how you want to work it out.  if you are going to rotate, i would like to put together a schedule that i could have for myself and forward to lavorato.  thanks.  let me know your thoughts.
