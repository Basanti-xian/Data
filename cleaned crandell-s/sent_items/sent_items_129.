attached is a spreadsheet summarizing hourly ttc and atc data for cob s/n from jan 1, 2000 to april 2001.  the data were obtained from the iso.after looking at the data, it is clear that, although the ttc values have not changed from '00 to '01, the atc values have decreased dramatically.  i believe the reason for this is the iso's attempt to prevent exports to the northwest.i propose that we send this spreadsheet to our iso rep (via sue mara) and ask him to explain the reason for the reduction.thanks
