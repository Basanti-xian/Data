hey bruce,the 600 and 725 are guaranteed, yes.  i didn't mean to imply cinergy wouldn't pay out; i meant more i'm basically comparing startup prospects with established company/operations prospects.  startup prospects are, i think, more risky.also, i realize there are distinct advantages from living in houston.  my "reluctance" is more of a family/moving type of thing.  it is an issue, but not a huge one.thanks,sean
